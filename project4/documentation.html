            I constructed the piano by getting images of each individual key and placed them
            together using relative positioning in CSS.
            In order to create the site I had to learn how to use the <a href="https://howlerjs.com/">Howler.js </a> library in order to play audio
            files in a simple manner. This involved creating the Howl objects, obtaining the audio files,
            and making a function to play the sounds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It took some time getting everything working 100% smoothly such as using event listeners for
            playing sounds since a regular function wouldn't work for audio files using an onclick event.
            The piano keys in all three interactions only change opacity when a sound is playing and when the mouse is being clicked or a key is pressed. Tying these interactions together took the most time and a lot of 
            troubleshooting.

            In terms of how I went "above and beyond", I learned how to check for speciic key presses
            and execute functions based on that. I learned how to check using this resource <a href="https://javascript.info/keyboard-events">here</a>.
            In addition, I learned how to show what link the user is currently on using Javascript from the resource <a href="https://www.xul.fr/javascript/navigation-bar.php">here</a>.
